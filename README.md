# AI-powered Auction Vehicle Damage Evaluator

Source code for post, [Image Identification and Classification with Amazon Bedrock, OpenSearch, andÂ OpenCLIP](https://garystafford.medium.com/image-identification-and-classification-with-amazon-bedrock-opensearch-and-openclip-5442baca1846). Build a generative AI-powered vehicle damage assessment application on AWS using Vector Engine for Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, AI21 Labs Foundation Models, and OpenCLIP. Read the blog post for complete instructions. A video demonstration of the application is available on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/vkouFozFSvE?si=Rot0JVXZ2OMtPN_0).

__NOTE:__ The vehicle image datasets are not included. You will need to download your choice of datasets and create embeddings. The damaged vehicle image database can be found on Roboflow Universe > CarDamagedDetection2 > Car-Damage-Type-Detection-End-Game: [Car-Damage-Type-Detection-End-Game Computer Vision Project](https://universe.roboflow.com/cardamageddetection2/car-damage-type-detection-end-game). The undamaged vehicle image dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle > [Undamaged Vehicle Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/garystafford/undamaged-vehicle-image-dataset).

## Example Generated Vehicle Description

```text
Ladies and gentlemen, we've got a great car for you here today - a 2021 BMW 330i! This 4-door sedan is a hardtop, with rear-wheel drive, a 2.00 liter, 4-cylinder engine with 255 horsepower, and an automatic transmission with 8 speeds. It's got some great options, including HD Radio, Bluetooth, Satellite Radio, Auxiliary Audio Input, and an MP3 player. The exterior is a beautiful gray, and it's got 57,550 miles on the odometer. The initial auction estimate is $34,560, but be sure to take a look at the images of the damage - they're going to recommend a devaluation of 93%, so we're going to adjust that to an auction estimate of $2,419. Happy bidding!
